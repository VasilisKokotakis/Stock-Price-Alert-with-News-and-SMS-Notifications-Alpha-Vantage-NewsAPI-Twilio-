# Stock Price Alert with News and SMS Notifications

This project monitors stock prices using the **Alpha Vantage API**.
If the daily price change exceeds a set threshold (default: **5%**), it automatically fetches the latest news about the company from the **NewsAPI** and sends formatted alerts via **Twilio SMS**.

## Features

* Fetches **daily stock data** from Alpha Vantage.
* Calculates the **percentage change** between yesterdayâ€™s and the previous dayâ€™s closing prices.
* If change > 5% (configurable), fetches the **top 3 latest news articles**.
* Sends alerts as **SMS messages** with stock info + headlines.
* Supports **YAML configuration** for safer key management.
